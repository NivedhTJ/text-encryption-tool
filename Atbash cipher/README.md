# 🕵️‍♂️ Atbash Cipher Tool (Python)

This is a simple command-line tool to encrypt and decrypt messages using the **Atbash Cipher** — a classic substitution cipher where each letter is mapped to its reverse in the alphabet.

## 🔤 What is the Atbash Cipher?

The Atbash cipher replaces each letter in the alphabet with its mirror image:
- `A ↔ Z`
- `B ↔ Y`
- `C ↔ X`
- ...
- `Z ↔ A`

It works the same for lowercase letters and leaves non-alphabetic characters (like punctuation and numbers) unchanged.
